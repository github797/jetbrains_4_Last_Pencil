# Last Pencil


**Last Pencil is a game where players take turns taking X pencils until none of them remain.** 

Players (the bot and the user) can remove not more than 3 pencils at a time. The player who takes the last pencil loses the game. 
A bot follows a winning strategy. If the bot's position isn't the winning one, it takes any number of pencils (1, 2, or 3) at random.
